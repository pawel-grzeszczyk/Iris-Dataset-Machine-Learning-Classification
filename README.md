# **Machine Learning with Iris Dataset**
By Pawe≈Ç Grzeszczyk

**Project overview**:  
Project's main goal is to create and evaluate the Machine Learning model which based on the iris parameters classifies it to it's most likely species.

The document is split into several parts that include:

- **Data aquisition** (reading the data file)
- **Data analysis** (quick analysis of numerical and categorical attributes supported with visualization)
- **Creating the training set** (splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing set)
- **Preprocessing the data** (creating a pipeline to optimise the data before feeding it to the ML model)
- **Multiclass Classification** (building a few models and selecting the best one)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** (tuning the model's hyperparameters in order to increase it's performance)
- **Launching the model** (testing the model on the test data and evaluating it's accuracy)

**Project files**
Main analysis is carried in juperter notebook file: `iris_analysis.ipynb`  
The dataset that I'm working on: `iris.csv` is also included in the directory.
